## 3.1. Process Overview

### 3.1.1. Initial Analysis
The AI begins by:
- Reading the Requirements.md to understand project goals
- Reviewing Tasks.md to identify current objectives
- Checking Rules for AI to ensure compliance

### 3.1.2. Task Execution
For each task, the AI:
- Analyzes requirements and constraints
- Develops implementation plan
- Executes necessary code changes
- Documents progress in ChangeLog.md

### 3.1.3. Validation
The AI ensures quality by:
- Verifying changes against requirements
- Running necessary tests
- Updating documentation
- Confirming task completion

### 3.1.4. Documentation
Throughout the process, the AI:
- Maintains clear records in ChangeLog.md
- Updates task status in Tasks.md
- Provides progress updates to developers
- Suggests improvements when identified
