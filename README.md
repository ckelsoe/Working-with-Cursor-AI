# Working with Cursor AI

I use [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). I struggled with it, but when I looked at a Reddit post, I saw that I was not alone. Then, one day, I had a breakthrough in understanding how to use Cursor effectively. 

I mentioned this to someone who asked if I had documented the process. This is the [documentation](https://github.com/ckelsoe/Working-with-Cursor-AI/wiki). 

Maybe it will be helpful to you. Let me know.
