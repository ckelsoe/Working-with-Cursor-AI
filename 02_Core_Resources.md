## 2.1. Rules for AI Management

The Rules for AI system uses a dual-management approach to ensure both flexibility and control in AI behavior. This setup allows for collaborative refinement of AI guidelines while maintaining stable operational rules through Cursor's preferences system.

## 2.2. Requirements.md

The Requirements.md file serves as the central reference point for all project specifications and technical requirements. This comprehensive document ensures that all development work aligns with the project's goals and maintains consistent standards.

## 2.3. Tasks.md

The Tasks.md file functions as the project's dynamic roadmap, tracking both completed and upcoming work. This living document helps maintain clear progress tracking and ensures systematic development approach.

## 2.4. ChangeLog.md

The ChangeLog.md file serves as the project's historical record, documenting all changes and decisions. This comprehensive log enables traceability and informed decision-making.

## 2.5. Document Cross-Linking

GitHub supports markdown links between repository files, enabling seamless navigation between project documentation.

### 2.5.1. Link Types
- **Repository Links**: Links to other markdown files
  ```markdown
  [Rules for AI](./Rules%20for%20AI.md)
  [Requirements](./Requirements.md)
  [Tasks](./Tasks.md)
  [ChangeLog](./ChangeLog.md)
  ```

- **Section Links**: Links to specific sections within files
  ```markdown
  [Timestamp Rules](./04_Timestamp_Management.md#42-project-requirements)
  [Development Process](./03_Development_Process.md#31-process-overview)
  ```

### 2.5.2. Best Practices
- Use relative paths for repository links
- URL-encode spaces with %20
- Include file extension (.md)
- Use lowercase for anchor links
- Test links after creation
